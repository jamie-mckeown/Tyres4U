# Description

I created a one-page site for a tyre business, intended to provide information to potential clients of said business. The information required includes an overview of the services offered, showcases a sample of reviews from previous clients, and informs potential clients of the business' location and opening hours. Additionally, I included a feature to allow potential clients to message the business through the business' Facebook page, which is their primary mode of contact with clients.
